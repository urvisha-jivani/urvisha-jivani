## üí´ About Me

üëã A Full Stack Developer passionate about crafting impactful digital solutions across diverse industries.

üìä Currently diving deeper into data analytics through the NPower Program, because building is powerful, but understanding data is game-changing.

üå± I love creating clean experiences, solving problems thoughtfully, and making tech work for people ‚Äî not the other way around.

üß† I enjoy mentoring, managing projects, and translating user needs into smart, maintainable digital solutions that truly help.

üì∏ When I‚Äôm not coding, you‚Äôll find me exploring trails, chasing golden hour with my camera, or learning something new just for fun.

‚ö° My motto: "Build with purpose, test with passion, and always keep learning."
